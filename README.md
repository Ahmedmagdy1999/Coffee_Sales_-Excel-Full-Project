### Overview

This project focuses on analyzing coffee sales data to extract meaningful insights and present them in an interactive and dynamic dashboard. The dataset, sourced from GitHub, includes various types of coffee sales across multiple countries. 
The primary goal is to analyze sales trends, identify key customers, and provide a clear visual representation of the findings.



### Project Workflow

 1- Data Acquisition

   The dataset was obtained from GitHub, ensuring a reliable source of information for analysis.


2- Data Inspection

   The dataset was carefully inspected to understand its structure and identify any inconsistencies.
 

 3- Data Cleaning

   Cleaning steps were performed to ensure the data was accurate and ready for analysis.
 

 4- Data Analysis

   A pivot table was used to analyze the data and answer key business questions.
 

 5- Data Visualization

   Pivot charts were created to visualize trends and insights effectively.
 

 6- Dynamic Dashboard

   An interactive dashboard was built to present findings and allow dynamic exploration of the data.


 

 ### Key Questions Addressed:

 1- What are the total sales over time?
 
 2- How are the sales distributed by country?
 
 3- Who are the top 5 customers by sales?
 

 
### Tools Used

  - Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, Dynamic Dashboard)

  

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

  1- Data Gathering:
  
  
   Customer Information: Collected Customer Name, Email, Country, and Loyalty Card using the XLOOKUP function.
    Product Information: Gathered Coffee Type, Roast Type, Size, and Unit Price using a combination of INDEX and MATCH functions.

2- Calculated Fields:

   Created a new column for Sales by multiplying Unit Price by Quantity.

 3- Data Cleaning:

 - Duplicate Check: Verified there were no duplicate entries in the dataset.
 - Converted coffee-type abbreviations into full names using the IF function.
 - Transformed roast-type names into full descriptions.
 - Standardized the Month column to show months as letter abbreviations (e.g., Jan, Feb) to avoid confusion.
 - Formatted the Size column to display values with the kg metric unit.
 - Converted Unit Price and Sales columns to U.S. Dollars for consistency.
 - Converted the dataset into an actual table to allow automatic updates when changes are made.


### Data Analysis

- Used Pivot Tables to answer key business questions:

   Total Sales Over Time
   Sales by Country
   Top 5 Customers by Sales

- Customized Pivot Tables and created corresponding Pivot Charts for effective visualization.

- Dynamic Dashboard:

  Designed an interactive dashboard with slicers and a timeline to enhance usability and enable dynamic exploration of data.


### Results

1- Key Insights:

 - The United States had the highest sales.
 - The United Kingdom recorded the lowest sales.
 - Top 5 Customers by Sales ( Allis Wilmore, Brean Dundredge, Terri Farra, Nealson Outtler, Don Flintiff )

2- Business Observations

- Sales for coffee types vary significantly, with certain types performing exceptionally well only on rare occasions.
- Sales are generally stable over time, but opportunities for growth exist.


### Recommendations

1- Boost Sales Strategy:

- Investigate and address reasons for low sales in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Consider launching localized campaigns, promotions, or offers tailored to customer preferences in these regions.
- Explore creating an online store to make purchases more convenient and expand the customer base.

2- Customer Loyalty:

- Launch a loyalty program for the top 5 customers, offering gifts or special pricing to encourage repeat purchases.
- Encourage customer engagement by running competitions, such as asking customers to share photos of them enjoying coffee on social media, with prizes for the posts with the highest reach.


### Conclusion

   This project showcases my ability to handle end-to-end data analysis, from gathering and cleaning data to creating actionable insights and building interactive 
   dashboards. The insights and recommendations provide a foundation for improving business decisions and driving sales growth
